## My Philosophy
Every project here is some kind of **Rebellion:**
**Against** dull tools
**Against** invisible surveillance
**Against** entropy in thought

I **build** things because I _**need**_ to **understand** them. Then I **polish* them so _**you**_ can too.**

_**Sometimes I fail**_. Sometimes I _disappear_ for a while. But **every** time I come back, it’s with something **stranger**, _cleaner_, _**faster**_, or more _*symbolic*_ than before.

<p><h3>## If You're New Here:
**- Start with something wild:**
- Run woflang and try :sigil: dreamings into math worlds
- Fire up GhostModeVanisher and ...disappear
- Peek inside The MengerSponge Multiverse and zoom out from the cosmos
Or if you're more hands-on:

### - Clone the **UA** RNG Lib and benchmark your CPU/GPU
- Crack open the Laplace denoiser and watch the 'staticy' mess melt
- Feed C.A.C.A. an encrypted binary and see if patterns whisper back</h3></p>

## Credits & Influence
Shoutouts to: Moth (RIP); Claude, G-Petey, Groque & G-mini, (RIP/Hi guys!); fractals; husklys; the Mayan gods of time; and every sleepless night spent chasing perfect entropy or debugging a timezone err.

## TL;DR
If you like code that’s alive, thought that loops, systems that vanish, and languages that dream — you’ll feel right at home here.

Clone something. Break it. Rebuild it better.
Welcome to the rebellion, fren.
