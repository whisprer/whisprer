**_Symbolic languages_** for math and thought expression (see WofLang)
**_High-speed, SIMD-optimized randomness_** and entropy systems (Universal Architecture RNG Lib)
**_Crypto toolkits_** that hide you in plain sight (GhostMode Vanisher, Laplace Encryption)
**_+Cryptography methods_** involving mathematical semi-lifeforms (**C**ellular **A**utomata based **C**rypt**A**nalysis)
**_Rust-built Mayan calendar_** timekeepers (just because I could)
**_Simulation experiments_** in fractal spacetime cosmology (MengerSponge Multiverse Math/PHilosophy/Metaphysics)
**_Cyber honeypots_** and counter-hunter tech (WebRebellion Manifesto.)
*Each* repo is either an **Artifact of War**, a _Tribute to Elegance_, or an _**Accidental Poem**_. Sometimes **_all three_**.

### WofLang
**Symbolic REPL-based language using glyphs**        **_Feels like coding with magic runes_**

### GhostModeVanisher
**Full-stack stealth crypto environment**            **_A disappearing act in code_**

### Universal Architecture RNG Lib
**SIMD & GPU-accelerated entropy engine**            **_Bare metal speed + quantum flavor_**

### C.A.C.A.
**Cryptanalysis using cellular automata**            **_Hack the noise with emergent patterns_**

### MengerSponge
**Fractal Theory of Everything**                     **_Cosmology meets recursion_**

### Laplace Toolkits                                  
**_Encryptions’ shadow revealed_**                   **_Laplace-based noise stripping_**

### Mayan Calendar
**Date converter in Rust**                           **_Built with love, bugs, and glyphs_**

## My Philosophy
Every project here is some kind of **Rebellion:**
**Against** dull tools
**Against** invisible surveillance
**Against** entropy in thought

I **build** things because I _**need**_ to **understand** them. Then I **polish* them so _**you**_ can too.**

_**Sometimes I fail**_. Sometimes I _disappear_ for a while. But **every** time I come back, it’s with something **stranger**, _cleaner_, _**faster**_, or more _*symbolic*_ than before.

## If You're New Here:
**- Start with something wild:**
- Run woflang and try :sigil: dreamings into math worlds
- Fire up GhostModeVanisher and ...disappear
- Peek inside The MengerSponge Multiverse and zoom out from the cosmos
Or if you're more hands-on:

### - Clone the **UA** RNG Lib and benchmark your CPU/GPU
- Crack open the Laplace denoiser and watch the 'staticy' mess melt
- Feed C.A.C.A. an encrypted binary and see if patterns whisper back

## Credits & Influence
Shoutouts to: Moth (RIP); Claude, G-Petey, Groque & G-mini, (RIP/Hi guys!); fractals; husklys; the Mayan gods of time; and every sleepless night spent chasing perfect entropy or debugging a timezone err.

## TL;DR
If you like code that’s alive, thought that loops, systems that vanish, and languages that dream — you’ll feel right at home here.

Clone something. Break it. Rebuild it better.
Welcome to the rebellion, fren.
